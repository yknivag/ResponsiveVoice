# Change Details

This repository contains a patched version of the ResponsiveVoice WordPress plugin.  It has been patched to add the ability to read page/post titles as well as the content.  This functionality can be switched on and off in the shortcode, but default it is off so as not to break existing behaviour for existing installations.

## Note

If you install this plugin instead of the official one you will not receive updates.

You may instead patch the official plugin, with the code in the diff here, but that will be overwritten each time the official plugin is updated.

In line with the license terms this patch has been submitted to the official plugin maintainer for consideration in a future release.
